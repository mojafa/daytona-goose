## Daytona-Goose-OpenAI Architecture Explanation

This architecture integrates three main components:

1. **User Environment**: Where you interact with the system
   - You provide code to run via the Goose CLI
   - Configuration files (`goose-config.yaml`) define how Goose interacts with Daytona
   - `daytona_runner.py` acts as a bridge between Goose and the Daytona package

2. **Goose Framework**: AI agent for handling code requests
   - Goose CLI processes your requests and manages sessions
   - OpenAI's GPT-3.5 generates responses and interprets code requests
   - When it detects "Run this code in Daytona" requests, it triggers the appropriate task

3. **Daytona Package**: Your Python package for Daytona integration
   - `daytona_executor.py` contains the core functionality for interacting with Daytona
   - `utils.py` provides helper functions
   - The package handles workspace creation, code uploading, and execution

4. **Daytona Cloud**: The secure sandbox environment
   - Daytona API receives requests from your package
   - Creates isolated workspace environments for code execution
   - Executes code securely and returns results

### Data Flow

1. You make a request to Goose: "Run this Python code in Daytona: [code]"
2. Goose processes this request through the LLM
3. Goose identifies this as a code execution task and calls `daytona_runner.py`
4. The runner script calls `daytona_executor.py` via subprocess (avoiding import issues)
5. The executor:
   - Creates a workspace in Daytona cloud
   - Uploads your code to the workspace
   - Executes the code in the sandbox
   - Retrieves and returns the results
6. Results flow back through the chain to Goose
7. Goose displays the results to you

This architecture provides:
- Isolation of execution environments
- Separation of concerns between components
- A clean interface for interacting with Daytona's secure sandbox
- Integration with AI capabilities through Goose

The subprocess approach in `daytona_runner.py` helps avoid the module import issues you were experiencing with your original setup.
